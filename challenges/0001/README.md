# 001: Hello Counter!

In this first challenge, we would like to create a Smart Contract that serves as a counter.

This is a very basic Smart Contract that should accept a function to set the conter number (call it `setNumber`) and incretent that number using the `increment` function.

## Acceptance test

All associated tests located in the `$(PWD)/tests/` folder should pass.

In your terminal, `cd` into this folder, then run `forge test` and make all tests pass ðŸ’ª

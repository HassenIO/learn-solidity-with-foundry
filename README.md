# Learn Solidity with Foundry

_A "Test Driven Development" approach to learning Solidity, using Foundry tests._

## How-to

Challenges are located in ths `challenges/` folder, and numbered for better organization.

Every challenge number, is an independant Foundry folder. Except that all share the `lib/` folder in the root of the project.

**Your mission:** I each challenge, read the instruction in the README and create the contract that solves the challenge.

In a nutshell, when you are in a challenge folder, run the tests using `forge test` and see them fail.

Then do the necessary to make the tests pass.

When you create the necessary contract Solidity code, and all the tests are green, try refactoring what is necessary taking into consideration security issues and gaz optimization.

_NOTA:_

This is for learning purposes. Please do not give up! Look in the internet about ideas and things you might not know.

And most importantly: Have fun and share your new expertise.

## Hints & Solutions

Some challenges have hints in a `HINT.md` file.

In case you can't find the solution, have a look in the `solutions/` folder in each challenge.

If you read the solution, please make a search about what you missed and try experimenting until you grasp what was missing.

In some cases, there are many possible solutions worth mentionning. So even if you found the answer, and are happy with it, please read the possible solutions to cover some important aspects about Solidity.

## Do you enjoy your challenges?

If so, I'm very happy with that. I know how it's important to learn by practice, and I think that learning Solidity by solving challenges is important and more fun!

This repo will evolve with more and more challenges. How can you be updated? Easy! Here are some ways:

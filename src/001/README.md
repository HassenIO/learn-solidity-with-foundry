# 001: Hello Counter!

In this first challenge, we would like to create a Smart Contract that serves as a counter.

This is a very basic Smart Contract that should accept a function to set the conter number (call it `setNumber`) and incretent that number using the `increment` function.

## Acceptance test

Associated tests are located in the `tests/001/` folder.

In the root of the project, all tests should pass when running `make test 001`
